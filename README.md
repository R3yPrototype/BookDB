# BookDB
BookDB is a website about books. It has a registration function connected to a database, it has the option for filtering the books by their genres, it has a wishlist page, and an account page where you can see your username, email, and change your password.
The interface is user-friendly, very aesthetic, and pleasing to go through content. It doesn't have a complex design but rather an efficient one, as you can see some hover effects that have a nice feeling to the eyes.
The registration and the validation process are made with sessions, so the content can be accessed only by an actual user (searching for a "user_id").
The log-out option (which is also a page) works as a session too, but it also adds the session_unset and destroy option with the redirection to the login page. In this way, by only clicking the log-out button, you become disconnected.
It is a page with big potential, well-structured, and a lot of things can be added to it. For instance, moving it from a prototype-kind of page and adding some payment options, a comments section, reviews, etc.
For what it is at this moment, it's a nice page.
